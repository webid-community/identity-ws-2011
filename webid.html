    <h2>1. Position Statement</h2>


    <p>The browser is both the interface to the
    Web as well as presenting the user&apos;s face to the world. The browser user should
    therefore be conscious of the face he is presenting at any time. He should be able to
    change it easily: identity selection should be a one-click gesture,
    cryptographically-secure, and web site independent. It should put the user in control
    of the information he share with each site. And it should be available
    now.</p>


    <p>The WebID protocol enables all of the
    above. It works in all browsers that correctly implement HTTPS and client-side
    certificates. But with a twist: it ties those certificates into the web in a
    <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">RESTful manner</a> allowing identities to be linked together in
    a secure social web of trust, that does not require central authorities, and that
    allows the user to control how he describes himself to each site he logs
    into.</p>


    <p>After explaining how the WebID protocol works,
    and listing its advantages, we will suggest a roadmap for future improvements in the
    browser that can take advantage of WebIDs.</p>


    <h2>2. WebID Overview</h2>


    <p>The WebID protocol is very simple and
    efficient. It requires only one more HTTP connection than the original resource
    requested, and the results of this connection can be cached.</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Bob requests
    Alice&apos;s protected HTTPS resource</li>
    <li>Alice&apos;s web
    server requests the client certificate on the TLS connection started above</li>
    <li>Bob&apos;s browser
    presents him with a selection of identities to choose from: <div class="figure"><img width=
    "576" height="235" src="webid_images/image001.jpg" alt="" /></div>Having selected one, the corresponding X509
    certificate is sent to Alice&apos;s server:
    <pre>  Public Key Info:
      Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
        Public-Key: (1024 bit)
        Modulus:
          00:e8:f9: [snip] :c6:af:2e
        Exponent: 65537 (0x10001)
      X509v3 extensions:
        X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
          URI: <span class="highlight">https://bob.net/id/bob#me</span></pre>
  It contains Bob&apos;s WebID, shown in bold red above.</li>
    <li>Alice&apos;s server:<ol>
      <li>checks that
    Bob&apos;s browser is in possession of the private key corresponding to the public key
    sent in the certificate, as specified by TLS</li>
      <li>extracts the
    URI from the Subject Alternative Name field of the certificate, which is known as
    Bob&apos;s WebID: a global identifier that refers to Bob via a document that describes
    him, in a machine readable and W3C-standardised way.<div class="figure"><img width="708" height="544" src=
    "webid_images/image002.jpg" alt="" /></div></li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Alice's server
    fetches Bob&apos;s WebID Profile at https://bob.net/id/bob in the example if an up to date
    version is not in the cache</li>
    <li>Alice&apos;s server
    checks that the profile relates Bob&apos;s WebID to the public key found in the
    certificate. If they match then she knows that she is in
    communication with the agent referred to by https://bob.net/id/bob#me</li>
    <li>Bob's identity
    is then checked as to its position in a graph of relations in order to determine
    trust according to some criteria decided by Alice combined with information from the
    cloud.<br/>
    This is outside the core of WebID, but it is important to
    understand how it can work. Alice might decide for example that only a group of
    friends who have given her a WebID personally may have access. Or she may be more
    lenient, and allow any of the <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">friends of those friends</a> to also access that
    resource, as specified by them in their profile located on their servers. Or she may
    only trust employees of her company, or of her department, to view that resource.
    Alice&apos;s server can do a lookup in a local file, crawl the web at intervals, or user
    web services to gather the data to help make that decision.</li>
    <li>Access is
    granted fully, partially, or denied and a representation is returned. Assuming the
    resource requested is a friend graph, a full representation could be returned to a
    friend, and a very limited one to an anonymous user.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The WebID placed in the X509 Certificate can be a https URL as
    shown above. Although the HTTPS scheme is currently the most widely implemented,
    WebID could also used with any dereferenceable scheme such as ftps://, ldaps://,
    xris://, accnt: (used by <a href="http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/">webfinger</a> ). It could also be used in future schemes such as
    <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xg-webid/2011Mar/0068.html">
    httpk</a> that would give up human readable URIs in order to
    avoid the centralisation problems of DNS.</p>


    <h2>3. Advantages of WebID</h2>


    <p>Issues of identity and privacy have been
    growing increasingly serious as the Web has become social over the last decade.
    Remembering login details has grown into a serious security issue as more sites asked
    for them than people had the ability to remember. And the inability to easily share
    restricted information across websites has become a visible problem to 100s of
    millions of people as they started finding themselves and those they wished to
    communicate with split across siloed services.</p>

    <p>Specifically, WebID offers the following
    advantages.</p>


    <h3>3.1 Overcoming Password Fatigue</h3>


    <p>Passwords are <em>difficult</em> to remember or
    they are easy to crack. As a result people tend to re-use them, making phishing
    attacks the biggest threat on the web, leading to a mistrust of new services. WebID
    uses TLS-client certificates and public key cryptography as shipped in current
    browsers in a way that enables the same certificate to be used across sites securely.
    Furthermore with the HTML5 supported <code>keygen</code> element, creating such a certificate is
    as easy as submitting an HTML form.</p>


    <h3>3.2 Comparison to OpenID</h3>


    <p><a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>
    reduces the account multiplication issue by allowing users to login
    to every site using the same global identifier. WebID was inspired by OpenID but
    improves it in a number of meaningful ways:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><strong>Protocol
    simplicity</strong>: the WebID protocol is a lot simpler,
    requiring only one more connection over and above the connection to the requested
    resource, where the result is cacheable. OpenID <a href=
    "http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/the_openid_sequence_diagram">requires seven TLS connections</a>, significantly more than WebID. These
    additional steps create opportunities for denial of service attacks, making it more
    difficult to secure and to debug.</li>
    <li><strong>User-interaction
    simplicity</strong>: OpenID requires the user to remember and type
    an OpenID URL. WebID hides this in the X509 certificate allowing the browser to offer
    select-and-click interaction. This is very helpful anywhere, but especially on
    <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/one_click_global_sign_on"> handheld devices</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These protocol simplifications create a cascade
    of additional benefits. The most interesting is that by being completely compliant
    with Web Architecture the trust can be moved from the single Identity Provider to the
    Web of declared relations between agents, opening the space for much more flexible
    trust policies and choices by service providers, in line with how business actually
    gets done.</p>


    <p>Nevertheless OpenID and WebID can work
    well. The OpenID profile can be the WebID
    Profile. For devices that have not implemented client-side certificates properly yet,
    OpenID can then be used for authentication.</p>


    <h3>3.3 Transport Layer Security</h3>


    <p>TLS-client certificates have been available in
    the browser since 1996, but their usage has been limited to a small number of sites.
    The organisation which generates the certificate is usually the same as the one that
    consumes it, giving the user little advantage over username/passwords layered on
    server-side https. Outside of very large and well-funded Defence related
    organisations, client-side certificates have thus had very poor adoption.</p>


    <p>The missing link is the global naming system
    that OpenID takes advantage of with URIs, and that allows one to potentially
    authenticate to all sites. What failed TLS was that X500 names were not Universal
    Identifiers, were not designed to form an interlinked web, and hence were not usable
    to authenticate to sites without those first having a federated agreement. By
    webifying TLS we enable global authentication and authorization through the creation
    of a distributed linked web of trust, at a much finer level of granularity than has
    been offered before.</p>

    <h3>3.4 Future Proof Protocol</h3>

    <p>Not only does WebID work with the Web as it is
    today, but it will be strengthened with the rollout of critical infrastructure
    elements such as DNSSEC, which can be used as <a href=
    "http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/16-12/ff_kaminsky?currentPage=all">Dan Kaminsky</a>
    explains in his <a href="http://dankaminsky.com/2010/12/13/dnssec-ch1/">DNSSEC Diaries</a>
    to publish public keys of services, a work being developed formally
    by the <a href=
    "http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dane/charter/">
    IETF Dane</a>
    working group. This can be used to increase trust in all server
    certificates, but in particular self-signed server certificates, which according to a
    report by the <a href=
    "http://www.eff.org/observatory">
    EFF Observatory</a>
    are three times more numerous than CA-signed certificates. By
    lowering the entry barrier to using cryptography, both WebID and Dane will help bring
    about an increasingly-secure Web.</p>

    <h2>4. Recommended Browser Improvements</h2>

    <p>All current browser-based authentication
    methods fail to give full control over identity to the user. We declare that browsers
    MUST give the user full visible control of their identity. With TLS, as with cookies,
    one should be able to see clearly which identity one is logged in under and be able
    to easily become anonymous again, as far as that is possible of course. The Firefox
    Weave team have shown what this could look like, making use of the URL bar&apos;s existing
    role as guarantor of server identity and extending it to client identity.</p>

    <div class="figure"><img width="278" height="157" src=
    "webid_images/image003.jpg" alt="" /><img width="337" height="202" src=
    "webid_images/image004.jpg" alt="" /></div>

    <p>Here the user can see what persona they are
    presenting to the site or if they are anonymous. It also permits the user to change
    identity or to log out. The browser could then make use of the information found in
    the WebID profile--linked to from the X509 certificate--such as finding a link to a
    picture which could then be displayed, or linking to the account management page as
    shown above.</p>

    <p>This WebID anchor can then be used by browsers
    to improve the user experience by:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>using bookmarking
    services linked to from the profile</li>
    <li>using the linked social
    graph to provide real time changes to address books as well as social web based spam
    protection</li>
    <li>building micropayment
    services by using the TLS cryptography layer, ...</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>

    <p>WebID allows users to authenticate easily and
    securely to any website in the world in a one click gesture without needing to fill
    out any new forms. The site can immediately personalise the experience given the
    information and social graph made available to it by the user (see <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/sketch_of_a_restful_photo">Sketch of a RESTful photo Printing service</a> ). This will allow innumerable applications
    to be built that improve relations between individuals and their friends, co-workers,
    employers, and vendors across domain and organizational boundaries.</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/">
    W3C WebID Incubator Group</a>
    is keen to work with browser vendors and Web service providers to
    help standardise the necessary formats, semantics, and RESTful protocols. Though we
    think one can go very far in the social web with intuitively designed authentication rules based on group membership,
    it is clear that longer term the development of a web trust logic will come to be
    very useful.</p>
